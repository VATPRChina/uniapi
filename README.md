# VATPRC UniAPI

This project targets providing an universal API server for all the services VATPRC requires.

## Architecture

TODO.

## Development

The application binary supports these commands:

```sh
vatprc-uniapi              # start the web application
vatprc-uniapi run          # start the web application
vatprc-uniapi openapi      # save the specification to openapi.json
vatprc-uniapi openapi -o api.json
vatprc-uniapi migrate      # apply pending database migrations
```

### Database

This server requires a local PostgreSQL server. Please start one and specify the
following in `settings.local.toml`.

```
[database]
url = "postgres://postgres:password@localhost/vatprc"
```

And, to migrate the database:

```
cargo run -- migrate
```

To create a new migration:

```
just new-migration MigrationName
```

### Discord bot

The service can optionally run a Discord bot alongside the HTTP API. It is
disabled by default; enable it in local settings and provide a bot token:

```toml
[discord]
enabled = true
token = "<discord-bot-token>"
```

When connected, the bot registers global `/ping` and `/metar` commands. `/ping`
replies with `pong`; `/metar icao:<airport>` replies with the latest METAR text
for the requested airport.

### Email notifications

ATC application review and training application response notifications can be
sent through an SMTP server. Email is disabled by default. Enable it in local
settings (or provide the equivalent `APP_EMAIL__*` environment variables):

```toml
[email]
enabled = true

[email.smtp]
server = "smtp.example.com"
port = 587
username = "smtp-user"
password = "smtp-password"
from = "VATPRC <no-reply@example.com>"
```

The SMTP connection uses STARTTLS.

### Flight plan validation updates

Connect to `ws(s)://<host>/api/flights/warnings/streaming` to receive flight
plan validation results for all active flights. The server sends the current
results as a JSON object keyed by callsign in the first text message, checks all
flight plans again every 30 seconds, and sends another complete snapshot only
when the results change. This includes flights appearing and disappearing. The
existing HTTP validation endpoints remain available for request-based checks.

## Testing

There is E2E testing for each API endpoint. It is still missing test coverage on some endpoints.

### Writing tests

Place the test for each API endpoint in `/e2e/src/**/*.test.ts`. The test folder structure should match the API endpoint's URL. For example, test for GET `/api/atc/applications/review-sheet` should be placed in `/e2e/src/atc/applications/review-sheet.test.ts` (prefix `/api` is stripped).

If a user is needed, check `getClient` from `/e2e/lib/backend.ts`. Use Vitest's `extend` to establish a shared context for different roles used in the same test file.

If some common data setup is required for the API endpoint (e.g. `/api/events` requires a present event), use Vitest's `extend` to establish a shared context to avoid duplication in setting up the data.
